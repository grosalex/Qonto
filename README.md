I've just made a basic android architecture with some models class instantiated from Json comming from web and displayed in recyclerview with a basic adapter.

I've been using volley to make web request because it's safe and easy to use wich was perfect for this fast task. I've been also using picasso to display images because it's the best lib for that.

I had an issue with picasso wich was not showing pictures and I made a realy bad trick to do so (replacing http to https) sorry.

I think I've made 60% to 75% I didn't have the time to improve the cache part (it will work a little bit thanks to volley but can be improved by using a background service to fetch and add a better management of it). I could improve it with lots of design for the ui and should add test. I've been missing something like one hour to do that.
